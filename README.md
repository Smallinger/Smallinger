### Hi there 👋

I'm a 31-year-old trainee IT specialist in system integration from Germany 🇩🇪.  
Programming is my passion — I love building useful tools and contributing to open source projects.  
I strongly believe in the power of open collaboration, even though it often takes a lot of time and effort ⏳.

If you like what I do, consider supporting me:
